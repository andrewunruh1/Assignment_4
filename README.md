# Assignment_4

The file is in the starter code folder.  

For this assignment I created a tool that analyzes and visualizes the major metrics of the portfolios across all of these areas, and determine which portfolio outperformed the others, then added 3 stocks of my own choice to compare to the professional's portfolios.

Needles to say the professional portfolios performed much better than the 3 stocks that I selected.  I was more interested in seeing how some shares that I am interested in have performed rather than trying to pick 3 stocks that may have been more comparable to the portfolios I had already analyzed.
